Functions:

RP2030 generates an 8MHz clock for the MCP2515 on GPIO7

RP2030 samples ADC128S022 every second.  Pipelining the data into the RP2030.  There are total of 8 ADC inputs.  ADC input 0 is connected to a MUX (CD74HC4067) which is a 16 channel MUX.  In total there are 23 sampled channels of ADC data.  MUX control lines MUX_S0 thru S3 connected to GPIO16 thru 19 of the RP2030, and mux chip select connected to GPIO14.

The ADC is connected to SPI0 (GPIO2 thru 4) and ADC chip select is connected to GPIO5.

An SDCard connection is also on SPIO0 and the SDCard chip select line is connected to GPIO1. 

The Data sampled by the RP2030 should be logged into the SDCard once per secon.

All analog data sampled by the RP2030 should be put into a CAN stream and sent twice per second.  The CAN connections are over SPI1 (GPIO8 thru GPIO11), with GPIO9 being the CAN CSn pin.
